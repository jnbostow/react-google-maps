#Udacity Neighborhood Map (React) Project

##Author: Jacki Bostow
##Description
This project was created to complete the requirements of my Udacity Frontend Nanodegree. This app uses the Google Maps API to display a map of my 5 favorite restaurants in the Seattle Lake City neighborhood.  A navigation tool, which can show/hide by selecting the nav icon, with a list of these restaurants is provided on the left hand side. When clicked, each link in this list opens the corresponding location's infowindow in the Google Map.  The contents of the infowindow is supplied with use of the Zomato API that generates information about each restaurant.
